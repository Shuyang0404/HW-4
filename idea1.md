This idea is going to be a jellyfish/octopus swims in the ocean.The octopus with has four legs move with its body.
It will swims in a random direction, and when the legs shrink the octopus will moves slower, and when legs strech out
it will moves faster with different water flow sound. When, mouse is pressed it will sprays ink/runs away with a sound
of squeezing or wind. Then if it srays ink, the ink covers all the screen. After few seconds, 
the ink runs down and octopus shows agian. 

Animation: octopus swims (use: random similar with the bouncing ball)
Interactions: sprays ink/runs away (mouseIsPressed+else)
Sound: squeeze and bubble/wind(represents the speed)
