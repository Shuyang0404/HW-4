This idea is about playing ping-pang, I would divide the scree in half. For the upper screen, there will be a 
ping-pang ball pops from a random dirction(with sound). I would draw a ping-pang racket that moves follows mouse. 
Then, when the ball touches the racket, it will bouncing back(in a random direction, with a knowck sound). 
Then next ball will be popped. Finally, there will be a score indicator on the top to count the score, 
once it reach to 11, whihc means the player catched 11 balls, the player will win the game(cheer sound).

Animation: bouncing, move follow the mouse
Interaction: catch ping-pang ball
Sound: 1.the ball is poped, 2.player catched it, 3. player missed it, 4. player win the game and 5. lose the game
